Hey!! I'm still new to programming so you might find a lotta erros (hopefully not tho). If you get error 403, it's no big deal just rerun the program.
You can run get_wordlist() once then put a # to make it a comment. So if you get any errors just go to the word list, delete the words that have been translated,
and rerun the program! (worked for me).
Error 404 just means the word didn't have a definition in the dictionary, so no need to worry the program'll automatically ignore it.
Any error 500+ means the server blew up or smth im not sure dw abt it too much and jus restart the program.
200 is what you want to see.
All these numbers only show if you're using the dictionary, so if you're translating to a non-english language no need to worry abt this
