Hey!! I'm still new to programming so you might find a lotta erros (hopefully not tho). If you get error 403, it's no big deal just rerun the program.
You can run get_wordlist() once then put a # to make it a comment. So if you get any errors just go to the word list, delete the words that have been translated,
and rerun the program! (worked for me).
